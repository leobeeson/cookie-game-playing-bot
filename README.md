# Game-Playing Bot: Cookie Clicker 

## Description
Automates UI actions for playing Cookie Clicker game, with the objective of maximizing `cookies per second` (CPS) produced.

## Behaviour
1. In `main.py`, experiment with different values for:
    * `game_duration`: How long you want the bot to play the game. 
        * Default = 300 seconds.
    * `check_interval`: How often do you want to check produced `cookies` (i.e. currency) and purchase available `cookie producers`. 
        * Default = 3 seconds.
2. Run `main.py` and find `Cookies per Second: $CPS` printed in the terminal after the end of `game_duration`.

## Requirements
1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in terminal.
5. Run `python3 main.py` (or `python main.py` if on Windows with no Python2).

## Improvements
* Handle exceptions with the `WebDriverWait` class to improve execution flow.
* Improve expressiveness of typing `List[tuple]` to ~ list[tuple[WebElement, int]] (in Python >= 3.9).

## Caution:
### Game Page Brittleness: orteil.dashnet.org
* The webpage hosting the game is very often down (i.e. "This site canâ€™t be reached. orteil.dashnet.org took too long to respond."), making playing the game, developing improvements, and testing improvements difficult.
